        <h1>Hey there,</h1>
        <p>My name is Ryan Gallagher, but you can call me G-dawg. That was my nickname back in highschool. Alright only
            a few people called me that. Alright I pushed it on a people but it never stuck. It is still used by some of
            my closest friends.</p>
        <p>
            This site is where I will hopefully write cool stuff. 
        </p>

                Scribenote makes documentation effortless for veterinarians. 
                Vets typically have to spend hours a day typing medical notes based on their appointments.
                Instead, Scribenote captures appointment audio and uses it to generate user friendly notes.

                Icarus Medical was a network built to connect family physicians with other specialist physicians.
                The goal was to reduce Canadian wait times for specialists care by improving the routing of patients
                through the health care system. While Icarus Medical did not succeed, it led me to the insight behind 
                the founding of Scribenote.
