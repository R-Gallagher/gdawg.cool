        <h1>Hey there,</h1>
        <p>My name is Ryan Gallagher, but you can call me G-dawg. That was my nickname back in highschool. Alright only
            a few people called me that. Alright I pushed it on a people but it never stuck. It is still used by some of
            my closest friends.</p>
        <p>
            This site is where I will hopefully write cool stuff.
